ðŸš€ Cloud Resume Challenge Lite

Project Overview

This project is a streamlined version of the popular Cloud Resume Challenge, demonstrating the deployment of a personal static website (resume) hosted on AWS S3 with CloudFront, backed by automated infrastructure provisioning using AWS CLI and Bash scripting.


---

Why This Matters

Showcases core cloud skills employers crave: infrastructure as code, AWS services (S3, CloudFront), automation, and web hosting â€” all essential for junior cloud and infra roles.

CloudFront distributes the static site globally with low latency

S3 stores the website content securely



---

How It Works

AWS CLI and Bash scripts automate the setup of the S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution

The static site files (HTML, CSS, JS) are uploaded to the S3 bucket

CloudFront CDN caches and serves the site worldwide
